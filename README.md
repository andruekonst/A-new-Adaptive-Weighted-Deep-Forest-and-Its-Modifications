# A new Adaptive Weighted Deep Forest and Its Modifications Implementations

There are two different implementations of Deep Forest modifications:
1. Adaptive Weighted Deep Forest (in directory `AWDF`), which is based on [official gcForest implementation](https://github.com/kingfengji/gcForest);
2. AWDF for the transfer learning (in directory `Transfer learning AWDF`), which is based on lightweight [gcForest implementation](https://github.com/STO-OTZ/my_gcForest/). Fit-predict interface is adapted to be able to handle the transfer learning task.

Please, follow the `README.md` files in `AWDF` and `Transfer learning AWDF` directories for thorough explanation of usage.
